When we calculate a new number we also move along to the next step in the sequence. Why is this important? Well, when we move to the next step in the sequence, the `last_number` and `second_to_last` must also change! If we calculate `current_number` as `last_number + second_to_last` without changing `last_number` or `second_to_last`, the `current_number` will never change. See the example below.
